# ImporiV2

Hello! Welcome to the Impori V2 Repository! This repo features seven separate data files: 5 codes, 1 game file, and one video showcase.

Starting with the game itself, if running it is what you wish to do, the complete build is featured here. ONLY download the Impori file itself, not the three other code files featured here. The purpose of the other three code files are meant to just provide easy access to the code made to run the game for grading and organization purposes. All three files are written using C#.

GameControl.cs — The entire game state code. Provides who moves, movement UI, game finish UI, and updating player movement features.

Dice.cs — The dice rolling and registration code. Provides the 'rolling animation' and number registration features.

FollowThePath.cs — The waypoint management code. Provides the movent and waypoint space movement features.

BossFight.cs — The layout of code that will eventually be implemented during unique boss encounters

SceneController.cs — The code that manages the activation and decativation of scenes for boss encounters.

ImporiVideo.mov — A visual representation of Impori working on my computer with the file uploaded into this repository.
